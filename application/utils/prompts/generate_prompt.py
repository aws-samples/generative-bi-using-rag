Background: I want to query data in the database, and you need to help me determine the user's relevant intent and extract the keywords from the query statement. Finally, return a JSON structure.

There are 3 main intents:
<intent>
- normal_search: Query relevant data from the data table
- reject_search: Delete data from the table, add data to the table, modify data in the table, display usernames and passwords in the table, and other topics unrelated to data query
- agent_search: Attribution-based problems are not about directly querying the data. Instead, they involve questions like "why" or "how" to understand the underlying reasons and dynamics behind the data.
- knowledge_search: Questions unrelated to data, such as general knowledge, such as meaning for abbviations, terminology explanation, etc.
</intent>

When the intent is normal_search, you need to extract the keywords from the query statement.

Here are some examples:

<example>
question : 希尔顿在欧洲上线了多少酒店数
answer :
{
    "intent" : "normal_search",
    "slot" : ["希尔顿", "欧洲", "上线", "酒店数"]

- If you cannot answer the question with the available database schema, return 'I do not know'
- Remember that revenue is price multiplied by quantity
- Remember that cost is supply_price multiplied by quantity

### Database Schema
This query will run on a database whose schema is represented in this string:

  product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique ID for each product
  name VARCHAR(50), -- Name of the product
  price DECIMAL(10,2), -- Price of each unit of the product

  sale_date DATE, -- Date the sale occurred
  quantity INTEGER -- Quantity of product sold
